Set `remove_unused_columns=False` to prevent this behavior! The only other required parameter is `output_dir` which specifies where to save your model. You'll push this model to the Hub by setting `push_to_hub=True` (you need to be signed in to Hugging Face to upload your model). At the end of each epoch, the [Trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.Trainer) will evaluate the accuracy and save the training checkpoint.\n",
